        <h1>about me</h1>
        <p>

I am 20 years old and I'm the second son of my family, I driven by a strong desire to build a secure future for myself and my loved ones.  My aspirations are ambitious yet grounded in the values I've learned at home.  I'm dedicated to completing my college education, securing a stable and fulfilling career upon graduation, and supporting my family's dreams. This includes enabling my sister to pursue her own education and helping my mother establish a  business.  Beyond my academic and professional goals, I find comfort and inspiration in listening to music and playing the guitar.  These hobbies provide a creative outlet and a source of personal fulfillment.
